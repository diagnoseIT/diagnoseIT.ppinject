This directory contains the files for the seminar paper of Philipp Keck in the seminar "Software Evolution", titled "Classification and Injection of Typical Performance Problems in Enterprise Applications".

The contents are based on the files corresponding to the example
presented in Chapter B (Java EE Servlet Container Example) of 
the Kieker user guide.
See the user guide (doc/kieker-userguide.pdf) for details.

The following changes have been made to the Kieker example:
- The CatalogActionBean#viewProduct() method now contains a Thread.sleep(1000);
- The namespace de.uni_stuttgart.iste.ppi has been added and contains the code for the Performance Problem Injection. Note that this code would typically reside in a separate library and is only included in the same project to simplify the build process.
- The src/main/resources/META-INF/aop.xml instantiates TheRampAspect as an example.

The code is in the "jpetstore-6-mybatis-jpetstore-6.0.1" folder.
The folder "jetty-hightide-jpetstore" contains the server.
Build and deploy the example with "ant build-all" on the command line.
Start the server with " java -jar start.jar" in the "jetty-hightide-jpetstore" folder.

A "TestPlan.jmx" is provided to be used with JMeter. When run against the server, it will store its results in the JMeter bin directory in a file called "results-default.jtl". The graphs shown in the paper have been created by filtering for rows with "label" == "View Product" and visualizing the "elapsed" values (duration of the respective request) over the "allThreads" value (number of concurrently active threads).
